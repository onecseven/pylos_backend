my take is that its really ambitious... its main problem is that the elements it inherits from the "tactics rpg" design line and the chess/pvp design line kind of work against each other. 

for example, some of the abilities are non-deterministic (chance-based, like blocking). which is good for encounter design in an rpg (to avoid repetition and having all the games feel the same) but it feels a little out of place in a competitive environment. it feels worse than chess in that sense because you can get screwed without having done anything wrong. there's a lot of settings to fiddle around to make like a custom game if you want to mitigate that, but I feel like thats a bandaid.

from the more competitive side, it inherits symmetrical pieces, so both players start with the same units. Which is great for chess, but it kind of deprives the player of the ability to construct their own team with the units they like and choose the kind of strategy they want to play. In that sense it's a little closed to the feeling of freedom that tactics rpgs provide. however, then you run into balance issues..

So I like what its doing, but in the end it just kind of feels like chess reskinned with fantasy characters, and with less elegant combat (the units have predetermined skills, and some of them have aoe)... Which is not bad, but it also feels like less than the sum of its parts.

## Tutorial  Outline
1. The goal of the game is to build a pyramid, and whoever places the ball at the top of pyramid wins. 
   1a. In order to accomplish this, you have access to a couple different moves. First, every turn you can place a ball on any empty spot on the board. 
   1b. You can also place a ball on top of four other balls!
2. To stay ahead of your opponent, you can raise a ball that's already on the field to a higher point of the pyramid. This way, you don't have to spend a ball from your inventory!
   2a. Clicking on a non-grayscale ball
   2b. This will reveal legal locations for raising the ball
   2c. Choose the location and hit confirm
3. Line and Cube Bonuses
   3a. Once you place a ball that forms a line or cube, the balls in that line or cube will begin shining brightly!
   3b. That's your chance! Select up to two of the shining balls to return them to your inventory.
   3c. Be careful! You can't recover balls that are holding up other balls.
   3d. Cube and Line bonuses only happen on the first two levels of the pyramid! This move is great for economy: you spent one ball to recover two, so you're one ball ahead instead of a ball down (from placing) or neutral (from raising).
  1. Complex move!
     4a. We can make a move that ties together both of the previous moves into one! Let's try it.
     4b. We target this ball
     4c. to this location, where it will form a cube!
     4d. then we recover two balls.
     4e. For a total of +2 balls to our inventory! If you can pull off this power move in a game, your opponent will be left in the dust.
